# The following example indicates all available properties and how they are to be added
# for over-riding the server values. Note that not all servers have to have entries in this file
# nor do all properties have to be defined for a single server. Only those server properties
# which are included in this file will overwrite the original server values.
# All entries must be prefixed with the id from the server table for the affected server, and 
# surrounded by brackets with a dot seperating it from the property name. i.e. "[103]."
